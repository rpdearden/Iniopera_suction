# Iniopera_suction
This repository holds the Python and R scripts used in "Evidence for high-performance suction feeding in the Pennsylvanian stem-group holocephalan Iniopera" 2023 Dearden et al. PNAS.

The files are titled as:
-Iniopera_Stretch: files associated with the gape analysis
-Iniopera_MAForce: files associated with the estimates of mechanical advantage and force
-Iniopera_ROM: files associated with the hyoid range of motion analysis
-Iniopera_VolumeExp: files associated with the estimate of 

They should be ready to go, though obviously you will have to modify file paths, and maybe update some of the code depending on how far into the future you are from the upload of these files.

I am currently working out how to best link to the Blender files associated with the scripts as they are larger than githubs maximum file size but I hope to have them up here soon. If you need them in the meantime please contact me at the address below.

All of the 3D models and data used in these scripts is linked to in the paper itself.

If you have any questions, think something is missing, or would like another file/version of a file please feel free to contact me at richard.dearden(at)naturalis.nl. Similarly if these scripts are useful to do something cool with fossils/in Blender I'd love to hear about it!
